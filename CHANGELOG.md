# Changelog

## 0.14.0

This version uses Bevy's **Required Components**,
along with other changes,
therefore many items have been changed.
Examples may help migration.

- `Path` component renamed to `Shape`. It is now the central component of a shape entity.
- `Shape` now includes fill and stroke data.
- `Fill` and `Stroke` are no longer `Component`s.
- Deprecated `ShapeBundle` in favor of the `Shape` component.
- `prelude` no longer exports `ShapeBundle`.
- Added `ShapeBuilder`: works similarly to `GeometryBuilder`
- Removed `GeometryBuilder` and `PathBuilder`.
- `ShapePath` now works similarly to `PathBuilder`,
  but implements `Geometry`,
  so it has to be used with `ShapeBuilder`.

## 0.13.0
- Support for Bevy 0.15.0.
- `Rectangle` now supports border radii (see `rectangle.rs` example).
- Removed deprecated `SpatialBundle` from `ShapeBundle`: `Transform` and `Visibility` are now added separately.

## 0.11.0
- Support for Bevy 0.13.

## 0.10.0

## 0.9.0
- Support for Bevy 0.11.
- `ShapeBundle` now contains the `spatial: SpatialBundle` field,
  which bundles together
  `Transform`,
